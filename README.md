# Vani Kanoria: Data Scientist

I'm a Data Scientist passionate about explainable machine learning and product strategy. I grew up being fascinating by Mathematics, which drew me to Data Analysis projects at Colgate University. From there, I transitioned into the tech world, analyzing data to shape business and product strategy at a fast-paced startup. Now, I’m further honing my expertise in machine learning as a Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania.

In addition to technical skills, I bring a unique perspective on high-growth tech businesses as an **<a href="https://eent.seas.upenn.edu/fellows/2024-cohort/#kanoria" target="_blank">Engineering Entrepreneurship Fellow</a>**, where I study the intersection of innovation, technology, and business strategy.

## Churn Prediction Model for  Sisense

In this internship project, I built two machine learning models to predict churn using features I developed from support and engineering tickets, customer call transcripts, product usage data and onboarding data. I achieved 94% test accuracy overall by combining the models.

## Explaining Medical Insurance Price Prediction Models

In this project I apply 4 different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forests, Decision Tree Regressor and XGBoost Regressor) to predict charges on medical insurance based on demographic characteristics of the holds of insurance. I then utilize feature importance functions in sklearn and SHAP analysis to attribute feature importance of each model.

## Workflow Use Case Clustering

As a Product Data Analyst at Unqork, I quantified characteristics of applications created using Unqork’s software and applied clustering algorithms to categorize use cases, leading to a pivot in product strategy and saving 70% of engineering resources allocated.

## Generating Fashion Images using Generative Adversarial Networks

I used Fashion-MNIST data to train a model that generates fashion images from random noise. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) uses a discriminator to predict which of the images are fake, and uses the feedback loop during training to improve upon the images generated.

## Modeling Credit Card Usage using Negative Binomial Distributions

How many credit cards do people in the United States own and why? This breakdown of the number of credit cards regularly used by different age groups sheds light on the preferred number of cards for different demographic groups, and may even provide hints about financial habits exhibited by them.

## Generative Probability Models Capturing Trends in Ticket Sales of the Movie ‘Wonka’ (2024)

This paper examines the ticket sales of the movie Wonka in the three months after its release by applying time-series probability distributions and including time-varying covariates such as weekend and holiday effects. The 2-segment Weibull Distribution calibrated to the data captures the presence of two behavioral segments in the population with differing propensities to watch Wonka.

## Decomposing Recent Protests in the US

In this analysis, I decompose 42533 unique protests or riots occurring across the United States from the beginning of 2020 to mid 2022 by location, nature, time frame, and associated actors, which are the organizations involved.

## End-to-end business plan for a biodegradable soil sensors

As an Engineering Entrepreneurship Fellow, I worked with teammates Ashley Cousin, Caleb Gupta, and David Bakalov to develop a product and market strategy, and financial and operations plan for biodegradable soil sensors developed by Penn researchers.

## Consulting Fortune 500 Insurance Company on Integrating AR/VR into their Value Chain to Improve Efficiency

I collaborated with Wharton MBAs Tanmay Sharma, Zachary Gross and Ziyi Zhou Collaborating advise Assurant Solutions, a Fortune 500 insurance provider, on leveraging Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies in their smart devices insurance division across their value chain. We presented a competitor analysis and Go-to-Market plan to implement the technology into Assurant’s existing business model
