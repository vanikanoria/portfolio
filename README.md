* Explaining Medical Insurance Price Prediction Models

In this project I apply 4 different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forests, Decision Tree Regressor and XGBoost Regressor) to predict charges on medical insurance based on demographic characteristics of the holds of insurance. I then utilize feature importance functions in sklearn and SHAP analysis to attribute feature importance of each model.
