* Explaining Medical Insurance Price Prediction Models

In this project I apply 4 different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forests, Decision Tree Regressor and XGBoost Regressor) to predict charges on medical insurance based on demographic characteristics of the holds of insurance. I then utilize feature importance functions in sklearn and SHAP analysis to attribute feature importance of each model.

* Workflow Use Case Clustering

* Generating Fashion Images using Generative Adversarial Networks

I use Fashion-MNIST data to train a model that generates fashion images from random noise, uses a discriminator to predict which of the images are fake, and uses the feedback loop during training to improve upon the images generated. I.e. make them more and more realistic and harder to distinguish from the real images.


**Probability Models**

* Modeling Credit Card Usage using Negative Binomial Distributions

How many credit cards do people in the United States own and why? This breakdown of the number of credit cards regularly used by different age groups sheds light on the preferred number of cards for different demographic groups, and may even provide hints about financial habits exhibited by them.

* Generative Probability Models Capturing Trends in Ticket Sales of the Movie ‘Wonka’ (2024)

This paper examines the ticket sales of the movie Wonka in the three months after its release by applying time-series probability distributions and including time-varying covariates such as weekend and holiday effects. The 2-segment Weibull Distribution calibrated to the data captures the presence of two behavioral segments in the population with differing propensities to watch Wonka.

**Data Analysis**

* Decomposing Recent Protests in the US

In this analysis, I decompose 42533 unique protests or riots occurring across the United States from the beginning of 2020 to mid 2022 by location, nature, time frame, and associated actors, which are the organizations involved.

* Consulting Fortune 500 Insurance Company on Integrating AR/VR into their Value Chain to Improve Efficiency

I collaborated with Wharton MBAs Tanmay Sharma, Zachary Gross and Ziyi Zhou Collaborating advise Assurant Solutions, a Fortune 500 insurance provider, on leveraging Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies in their smart devices insurance division across their value chain. We presented a competitor analysis and Go-to-Market plan to implement the technology into Assurant’s existing business model
